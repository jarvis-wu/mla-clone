      `I am so sorry I have no time to call you.
      I've been so busy recently and I don't want.
      Do you recall the park where we've spent for whole night?
      We walked and talked till the sunrise.
      Public exam's coming, you've got to be hard working.
      You should not be as lazy as I'm being.
      I will always stand by you; so don't be afraid though I can't give you any note.
      Coka, Coka, Coka, Coka, if you still remember me, just call me when you are free.`,

      songLyrics: 
      `我間中仍會想我們會見面，在那間紅磡近黃埔的商店。
      你若然還記得那諾言，曾說今天我們流浪到海邊。
      你照片留在一封情信裡面，每一天仍是照舊看它一遍。
      我仍然還記得那笑臉，曾在當天我們遊玩過夏天。
      我都曾寫你在每天的日記，但放棄你卻像再沒可能夢想，像一個沉悶的獨唱。
      你照片留在一封情信裡面，每一天仍是照舊看它一遍。
      兩年前遊過的動物園，來到今天我們流浪到那邊？
      我都曾寫你在每天的日記，但放棄你卻像再沒可能夢想，像一個沉悶的獨唱。
      但放棄你卻像再沒可能夢想，像失去甜蜜的合唱。`,

      This is the last night I think of you.
      Your name is Victor Ching, how do you do?
      I phoned you this morning you couldn't hear me, I sent you letter you couldn't receive.
      It's my favorite game, but I have changed.
      It's too late to say I miss you Victor Ching, and you are on your way to Stafford in UK.
      I know it's too late to say I'm fond of you.
      You've got a girl from Singapore who you didn't like before.
      I love you when you no longer love me.
      I need you when you no longer need me.
      You wanted me, but you have changed already.
      It's too late to say I miss you Victor Ching...`,

      I waited for your call everyday, did you know?
      I scared to call you anyway, you didn't know.
      Then we met in a rainy day; I remember how you dress that day.
      I forgot what I wanted to say when I saw your face.
      It's just like happened yesterday, but now you fall away.
      Oh now you fall away.
      Where are you now?
      Why can't we be ourselves just like yesterday?
      Edward, we were good pen friends and did you ever believe me?
      When I say "I don't need to be free if you could only stay with me."
      I don't need to be free if you could stay with me.`,

      I just open all your skin then I take a small bite.
      Once I have a wonderful dream about you, we were dancing in the sea and the fishes all swimming around us.
      Come with me so I can show you big boat that I built.
      Let's go for a ride.
      I promise it will fly to the sky where no one cries.
      Banana you will see the clouds beneath our feet to the space where twinkle stars saying hello and smile, they're shinning bright happily.
      Will we see each other any more after ten years?
      Why don't you tell me you’re falling ill and not happy?
      Please stay well and be tasty.
      I don't want to see you be grumpy.
      Please stay strong and be healthy.
      We still have a lot to do like exploring the whole world.
      You're the only one can't be replaced.
      Hey you, listen, banana you're the best, man!`,

      `Cos running business is not your gift, why don't you close it, why don't say 'damn it'?
      Depression in your shop of Mong Kok.
      Silence on Monday, no change on Thursday.
      But Josephine, you may think your pals cannot lose you.
      Probably they need you so much more than they love you.
      So why don't you abandon them?
      Let yourself be free.
      This world is bigger than what we always believe in.
      So why don't you try to fade out from your dream of dreams?
      Try to take the other risks.
      Your life should not be like this.
      Every color we can be.
      The only thing I've bought in your shop was a $10 candle with some nice smelling.
      It couldn't help you to pay the rent, couldn't resist hazards nor prevent disease.
      But Josephine, you know your shop is cutie and beautiful.
      The truth is, you know this beauty can't make you happy.
      So why don't you abandon them?...`,

      能用些什麼字與什麼詞，描述你在夢中那樣美艷？
      夢中，夢中你跟我是情侶，一起執迷；一起呼叫在太陽裡。
      然後我在七時五十六分醒時，無法再睡著覺，我便要上學。
      可不可以話你像個大南瓜和紅豆沙般美？
      沒有玉蝴蝶形容王菲都很美。
      沒有漂亮的詞仍認得出你。Lalala...`,

      You don't wanna kiss me.
      You just wanna show your beauty.
      You don't wanna know me.
      You know you're not just a love song to me.
      You've ever sent your photos to me.
      Watching your face is an interesting journey.
      Oh my Phoebe, I wanna tell you my little story.
      Can you talk to me when I'm lonely?
      Can we talk not only when you're lonely?
      I know you Phoebe.
      I think I trend to know you completely.
      You don't wanna kiss me.
      You just wanna show your beauty.
      You don't wanna know me.
      You will never send all your love to me.
      So please don't say "May be we may meet one day."
      This sentence could not last more than one day.
      Cos you know I'm not the only one be missed by you as same as I don't only miss you.`,
